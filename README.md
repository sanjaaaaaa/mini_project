**Detecting deceptive content in social media** involves analyzing textual, visual, and behavioral patterns to identify misinformation or disinformation, as if now i devepled an web application just for text infromation others data format will be devepled soon. Techniques include Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image and video verification, and machine learning models for classification and pattern recognition. Hybrid systems combining rule-based approaches and AI are effective, especially when integrating cross-modal data. Challenges include adapting to evolving tactics, ensuring fairness and bias mitigation, and achieving real-time detection. Public datasets like LIAR and FakeNewsNet are instrumental in training and validating models for robust detection systems.
